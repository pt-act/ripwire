//  Run one piece of work on N threads whose STACK SIZE is chosen, not inherited. std::thread cannot ask for a
//  stack, and the default differs by a factor of sixteen across the platforms this tree ships on (512 KiB on a
//  macOS secondary thread, 8 MiB under glibc), so work whose depth is data-dependent — libstdc++'s regex matcher
//  recurses once per state it visits — gets a stack it can state and bound instead of whatever the platform gave.
//
//  POSIX, inline: pthread_attr_setstacksize + pthread_create + pthread_join, nothing wrapped. A stack of S bytes
//  is an address-space reservation; pages are committed only as deep as the work actually recurses, and returned
//  when the thread exits.
//
//  The work pulls its own share from shared state (an atomic cursor), so a thread that fails to start costs
//  parallelism, not coverage: the threads that did start finish the work. A thread the system refuses the full
//  stack is retried with half, down to 8 MiB. ONE size is then SETTLED — the smallest any started thread got — and
//  every thread is told that size, and no thread runs any work until it is settled (the threads wait on a gate
//  the creator holds). So a piece of work never sees a size that depends on which thread picked it up: work that
//  derives a limit from its stack derives the same limit on every thread (determinism, CLAUDE.md non-negotiable
//  #2). When NONE starts, the work runs once on the calling thread and is told kCallerStackBytesFloor — the
//  caller's stack is not this header's to measure, so the work plans for the smallest one this tree runs on. The
//  settled size is RETURNED, so a caller whose answer depends on it can disclose it.

// still a planning number, not a measurement: running these callers on runOnStackThreads with the SETTLED size (and
