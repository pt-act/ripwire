// The low 64 bits of lhs * rhs, through the seam in infra/platform.h.
//
// This briefly read `return lhs * rhs;` on the argument that unsigned arithmetic is already modulo 2^64, so the
// old `unsigned __int128` product and its mask "bought nothing". The VALUES were identical — 59,120,289 pairs
// checked against the original, zero disagreements — and the conclusion was still wrong, because value
// equivalence was not the property the wide type was there for. It was there to be SANITIZER-clean: G1's
// `integer` group flags a wrapping uint64 multiply, -fno-sanitize-recover=all makes that fatal, and the narrow
// body aborted every asan-flavour crawl on the first byte of the first hash (rc=134). Three comments in this
// tree already said so — clones.h:546, test/harnesscommon.h:31, and gitblob.h:13, which names this very
// function as the posture it copies and records that the asan tree found it "on the first receipt".
//
// What the seam adds over simply restoring the old body: MSVC has no `__int128` at all on x64 (C4235), and also
// none of that sanitizer group, so it wants the plain multiply — a per-compiler answer, which is exactly what
// infra/platform.h is for and what osswitchcheck arm H exists to force. The GNU/Clang arm is byte-for-byte the
// arithmetic this function has always done, proven at the object level rather than by reading: the .s at -O2,
// and under the asan flavour's own flags, is identical to the one this file produced before the detour.

// has unsigned `char` and AppleClang lacks the check, which is why six copies sat green for years — see the
// commit that added this). Absorb through here; never open-code `h ^= c` again.
