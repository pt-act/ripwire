// stdinline.h — the ONE byte-safe line reader for every stdin-consuming surface (R4).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `std::getline( std::cin, line )` is not byte-safe under the G1 sanitizer stack.
// libc++'s `getline( basic_istream&, basic_string& )` refills through a one-character fallback
// (`istream:1283`, `_CharT __1buf = __next;`) whenever the streambuf exposes NO get area — which is
// exactly the case for `std::cin`, whose stdio-synced buffer keeps `gptr() == egptr()` on every read.
// That assignment narrows `int_type`(int) to `char`, so ANY byte in 0x80..0xFF trips
// `-fsanitize=integer` (implicit-integer-sign-change) and, with `-fno-sanitize-recover=all`, ABORTS
// the process mid-request. Consequence before this file existed: the whole `--mcp` server plus the
// two `-`-from-stdin CLI verbs were sanitizer-DARK for non-ASCII input — a hostile UTF-8 byte killed
// the asan build instead of being answered, so no gate could observe behaviour past that byte.
// The owner ruling (R4, 2026-07-29) is an explicit reader here, NOT a UBSan suppression.
//
// A real `basic_filebuf` (every `std::ifstream` getline in this tree) keeps a get area, so
// `__first != __last` and the narrowing branch is never taken — those sites are unaffected and were
// probed to confirm it. Only the `std::cin` family needed replacing.
//
// PARITY CONTRACT (byte-for-byte with the getline it replaces — every MCP/batch gate must stay
// byte-identical, so this list is the specification, not a summary):
//   • the string is CLEARED first, then grows dynamically — a >1 MB line is never split into garbage
//   • the '\n' delimiter is CONSUMED and NOT appended
//   • a trailing '\r' is LEFT IN PLACE — CRLF input yields "...\r", exactly as getline does today
//     (callers that care already strip it; none may start seeing a different string)
//   • an embedded NUL is appended like any other byte
//   • a final line with NO trailing newline is still delivered once, and the call AFTER it reports
//     end-of-stream — i.e. false is returned ONLY at EOF with nothing accumulated
//
// stdio-vs-iostream mixing is safe here: nothing in this tree calls
// `std::ios::sync_with_stdio( false )`, so `std::cin` and `stdin` share one buffer and one position.

// Byte safety comes from staying on fgetc's int contract and doing the only narrowing EXPLICITLY, through

// ── input blow-up guard: a BOUNDED line reader for peers whose line length is NOT the caller's own
// invariant to keep unbounded (the MCP stdio request line — readByteSafeLine's own parity contract above
// is deliberate for the trusted callers that need it: a git-pipe reader must never split a long path, so
// growing without limit is the CORRECT behaviour there, not a bug to fix everywhere).
//
// A stdio JSON-RPC peer is untrusted the same way an HTTP client is (mcpserver.h bounds a request body at
// kMaxBodyBytes before it ever reaches the JSON-RPC layer — see runMcp()'s own comment on this reader),
// but stdio had no equivalent: one line with no '\n' grows the buffer for as long as the peer keeps
// writing, so a single hostile or runaway request can exhaust memory on a long-lived server that would
// otherwise happily keep serving every request after it.
//
// Same fgetc contract and the same byte-safety as readByteSafeLine (explicit unsigned-char narrowing —
// see readByteSafeLineCore's comment); the only difference is what happens once `line` reaches maxBytes:
// further bytes of THIS line are read and DISCARDED (not buffered) rather than growing `line`, so memory
// stays bounded at maxBytes regardless of how long the peer's line actually is, and the stream position
// still recovers at the next '\n' — the call after an overflowed line reads the NEXT real line, never a
// decoded fragment of the runaway one. `line` holds only the first maxBytes bytes when overflowed is set;
// callers must not dispatch it as if it were the whole request (it isn't).
