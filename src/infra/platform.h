//  platform.h
//
//  The compiler/platform substrate every other infra header sits on: the attribute
//  macros and the cache-line interference sizes. Namespace is `infra::platform`.
//
//  Split out of this tree's own fastmath.h (2026-08-09) along the line "describes the
//  MACHINE" vs "computes a NUMBER": ALWAYS_INLINE, memorycopy, and a cache-line width
//  are facts about the compilation target, not math, and a header that needs only
//  those should not have to pull in fastmath.h's number helpers to get them.
//  fastmath.h #includes this header, so its own includers still see ALWAYS_INLINE,
//  memorycopy, and the interference sizes exactly as before this split.
//
//  PORTING NOTE — this file is hand-copied, file for file, to and from a companion
//  C++ game-math tree that vendors the same infra set. Keep the sibling include below
//  BARE (`#include "Diagnostics.h"`, never a directory-prefixed path) — the
//  destination tree's layout differs and a hardcoded prefix breaks on arrival.
//
//  Every macro and constant below has a real call site above this layer; nothing is
//  kept "in case". (The companion tree also carries a `memorycopyinline` macro
//  immediately below `memorycopy` — there is no caller for it in this tree, so it is
//  not mirrored here.)

// Every macro in this section picks a spelling by COMPILER IDENTITY, never by operating system. These are
// language extensions, not platform features: clang-cl compiles for Windows and has the GNU spellings, while a
// hypothetical cl.exe on another OS would not. `test/osswitchcheck.sh` arm A enforces exactly that distinction —
// an OS-conditional name in a directive outside src/infra/os.h is a FAIL — and src/infra/Diagnostics.h §1/§1b
// set the house shape this section follows. Architecture macros (`_M_X64`, `__aarch64__`) are a third axis and
// are fine here; the cache-line block at the bottom of this file already keys on them.
//
// The GNU arm is `__clang__ || __GNUC__`. The `#else` arm is MSVC's cl.exe, the second supported front end
// (CONTRIBUTING.md: Unix/Linux/macOS first, native Windows second, clang-cl primary and cl.exe must also build).
//
// WHERE THE REST OF THE SEAM IS, and why it is not all here. Diagnostics.h is the layer BELOW this file — this
// header includes it, it includes nothing of ours, and it is deliberately library-free so every standalone
// harness in test/ can compile it alone. It therefore cannot use the macros below, and it carries the six its
// own macros need (RW_TRAP, RW_UNREACHABLE_HINT, RW_LIKELY, RW_COLD, RW_COLD_NOINLINE) in its §1c.
// That is a LAYERING split, not a second seam: no spelling is defined in both files, and each one lives where
// its only consumers are. A new extension goes here unless Diagnostics.h is the only caller.

// fastmath.h::isFiniteFast and charconvcompat.h::isInfiniteBits.
//
// BE CLEAR ABOUT WHEN THAT IS LIVE, because the flags say it usually is not. Every architecture arm of this
// build's flag selection that passes -ffast-math passes -fno-finite-math-only immediately after it (the native,
// Apple-Silicon, x86-64-v3 and generic arms alike), so on the builds actually shipped here, finite-math
// assumptions are OFF and the barrier is defending against a configuration nobody currently compiles. It earns
// its place as a guard on the callers, not as a load-bearing part of today's build: drop the -fno- from one arm
// and the test silently becomes constant true, which is exactly the failure a bit-pattern check exists to avoid.
//
// The MSVC arm is EMPTY, and the reason is the flag this tree passes rather than a claim about the compiler.

// to defeat and a barrier would cost a register round-trip for nothing. It would NOT be safe to assume the same
// under /fp:fast: Microsoft documents that model as licensing exactly this assumption — their own example is
// `NAN == NAN` evaluating to 1 — so if an arm ever adopts /fp:fast, this is the arm that has to grow a body,
// and the empty one becomes a bug rather than an optimization.

// Wrapping multiply, sanitizer-clean
// ==========================================================================
// The low 64 bits of a * b. Trivial arithmetic, and it needs a seam for one reason: the tree builds under G1's
// `integer` group with -fno-sanitize-recover=all, and that group flags `a * b` on two uint64s as
// `unsigned-integer-overflow` the moment the product exceeds 2^64 — even though C++ DEFINES the wrap. Every
// FNV-1a step does exactly that, so a narrow multiply aborts the sanitizer build on the first byte of the first
// hash of every crawl (measured: rc=134 at hashutil.h, `1469598103934665703 * 1099511628211`).
//
// The house answer to that sanitizer, everywhere it comes up, is to write arithmetic that genuinely does not
// overflow rather than to suppress the check — src/infra/gitblob.h says it explicitly ("every modular add is
// done in uint64_t and masked back (the same posture infra/hashutil.h's multiplyModulo64 takes)"), and its
// rotate masks the bits it is about to shift out for the same reason. So this does the multiply in a type wide
// enough to hold the whole product and masks back, which is not an overflow at all and needs no annotation.
//
// What does the work here is the WIDE multiply: at 128 bits the product of two uint64s cannot wrap, so
// `unsigned-integer-overflow` has nothing to report. The mask is intent-documenting and free — it folds away at
// -O2 — but it is NOT what keeps the narrowing clean, and an earlier version of this comment claimed it was.
// Measured 2026-09-21: the `integer` group's implicit-integer-truncation does not fire on an EXPLICIT
// static_cast, masked or not; both variants run clean. It fires on an implicit narrowing (`std::uint64_t out =
// wideProduct;`), which aborts at rc=134. So the cast must stay explicit; the mask is a courtesy to the reader.
//
// MSVC has neither the 128-bit integer nor that sanitizer group, so its arm is the plain wrapping multiply —
// correct, and the cheapest thing that is correct. This is the whole reason the function is here rather than
// written out at its one call site: `__int128` is a GCC/Clang extension, test/osswitchcheck.sh arm H refuses it
// outside this seam, and the refusal is right — the spelling needs a per-compiler answer.

// Checked integer arithmetic
// ==========================================================================
// GCC and Clang answer "did this overflow?" with one instruction and a flag read. MSVC has no counterpart, so a
// portable twin re-derives the same answer from the operands. Both have the SAME contract, which is the
// __builtin_*_overflow contract and not the C++ one: `out` is ALWAYS written, with the mathematically correct
// result when the return is false and the wrapped two's-complement result when it is true, and a true return is
// never undefined behaviour. Callers rely on that — layout.h evaluates a constant expression and reports
// out-of-range, statclock.h clamps a timespec conversion.
//
// WHY THE PORTABLE TWIN IS COMPILED EVERYWHERE, not just on MSVC. An arm that only compiles on the one platform
// no one here can run is an arm nobody has executed. These are `constexpr` and always compiled, the static_asserts
// below evaluate them on EVERY leg including this one, and only the CHOICE between twin and builtin is
// conditional. A bug in the MSVC path therefore fails a macOS build, not a Windows CI round.
//
// Each twin computes the wrapped result through the unsigned type of the same width, because signed overflow is
// itself UB and computing it to test for it would be the bug these functions exist to avoid; the test then reads
// only the SIGNS of the operands and of that defined result.
