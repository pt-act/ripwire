// pathguard.h — THE ONE RULE for "this sidecar name is a symlink, so do not write OR read through it", and
// the two atomic opens that ENFORCE it rather than merely describing it (round 3 added the read; see below).
//
// WHY IT IS ITS OWN HEADER. The rule was born at the MCP edit seam (mcpedit.h, A4-F14) because that is
// where following a link loses an agent's edit. It was never given to the SIDECAR writers, and that gap was
// a reported vulnerability (CWE-59, link following): `.ripwire_quality_baseline` (quality::writeBaseline),
// `.ripwire_notes` (notes::writeNotes) and `.ripwire_arch_baseline` (archWriteBaseline) each opened a FIXED
// name with a truncating open — ofstream( path, trunc ) twice, fopen( path, "w" ) once — and a truncating
// open resolves its final path component through the filesystem's symlink layer. A repository carrying a
// symlink at one of those names turned the tool's own write into an arbitrary-file truncate anywhere the
// invoking user could write. Reproduced on the shipped binary: a victim file holding `important user data`
// came back holding baseline content, and the sidecar was still a symlink afterwards.
//
// The fix for a rule that exists in one place and is missing in three is not a fourth copy of it, so the
// PREDICATE moved here — where a sidecar writer can reach it without including a JSON-RPC server, and where
// a fifth writer joins the rule instead of re-deriving it.
//
// ── ROUND 2: THE FIRST FIX WAS CHECK-THEN-OPEN, AND THAT IS A SECOND DEFECT (CWE-367, TOCTOU) ─────────
//
// The first fix put an lstat/S_ISLNK REFUSAL immediately in front of each writer's unchanged truncating
// open. It closed the reported attack and was honest about its own limit, and an external reviewer then
// flagged the limit as its own finding, correctly. The guard was ADVISORY: lstat(2) answered a question
// about the destination at one instant, open(2) re-resolved the same path at a later one, and anything that
// replaced the entry in between made the write follow a link after all. A guard the code then relies on for
// safety is not a guard; it is a description that happened to be true when it was read.
//
// The stated reason for stopping there was that std::ofstream cannot express O_NOFOLLOW portably. True of
// ofstream, and not true of the problem: the writers do not need ofstream, they need a descriptor. So the
// check and the create are now ONE syscall, and it is the only one a writer makes:
//
//     ::open( path, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_NOFOLLOW | O_NONBLOCK, 0666 )   (round 4: O_NONBLOCK, then fstat, then ftruncate
//                                                                          in place of the O_TRUNC it once carried)
//
// O_NOFOLLOW makes the KERNEL refuse a final component that is a symlink, at the instant of resolution.
// There is no window because there is no second resolution — whatever the entry is when the kernel looks
// is what the kernel acts on. POSIX, and present on both targets (macOS, Linux). MSVC is explicitly not a
// target for this project, so there is no portability scaffolding here and none is wanted.
//
// WHERE lstat SURVIVES, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A RELAPSE. isSymlink stays, for two callers that are not the
// sidecar guard:
//
//   - mcpedit, whose tmp+rename publish genuinely wants to KNOW (it refuses into a JSON-RPC error object
//     and never opens the destination at all, so there is nothing for an atomic open to be atomic with);
//   - openNoFollowTruncate itself, AFTER a failed open, to decide which sentence ELOOP has earned. ELOOP
//     is also what a symlink LOOP in an earlier directory component returns, and printing "that path is a
//     symlink" at a path whose last component is a directory would be a false security claim rather than
//     a diagnosis. That lstat is racy too, and it does not matter in the slightest: it cannot decide
//     whether to write. The worst a lost race can do there is pick the less specific of two refusals.
//
// The distinction is the whole point of the round: a check that GATES an open is a vulnerability; a check
// that WORDS an error is a message.
//
// WHY THE PREDICATE IS SHARED BUT THE REFUSAL TEXT IS NOT ONE SENTENCE. The two seams fail in OPPOSITE
// directions, and a single message would have to be wrong about one of them:
//
//   - mcpedit's atomicWrite is tmp+rename. A rename REPLACES the link entry with a regular file and leaves
//     the real target untouched — the edit silently goes nowhere. Data-losing, not a write primitive.
//   - the three sidecar writers truncate in place. The link is FOLLOWED and its target destroyed, while the
//     link entry survives — an arbitrary write.
//
// So `isSymlink` is one spelling (lstat, never stat: inspect the LINK, not what it points at) and each
// caller says what would actually have happened to the user's file. Claiming the wrong mechanism in a
// security refusal is the kind of dishonesty in output the project's non-negotiables rule out; a shared
// sentence that fits neither seam would be exactly that. The same rule is why an open that failed for some
// OTHER reason — a directory at the name, a read-only tree, a full disk — reports its own errno instead of
// being folded into the symlink sentence, which would turn every failure into a security event.
//
// DELIVERY differs too, and deliberately: an MCP verb refuses into its JSON-RPC error object, a CLI sidecar
// writer refuses onto stderr. openNoFollowTruncate below is the stderr half, used by the three sidecar
// writers; mcpedit takes the predicate alone and keeps its own error payload.
//
// THE MODE, 0666, IS NOT A CHOICE — it is what std::ofstream( path, trunc ) and std::fopen( path, "w" )
// both request, and the process umask narrows it exactly as before (0644 under the usual 022). Naming a
// mode by hand is the one thing moving from a stream to a descriptor forces, so it is measured rather than
// asserted: test/sidecarsymlinkcheck.sh's (g) arms create each sidecar under `umask 000` and require 0666,
// which is the only umask under which a wrong 0644 is visible at all.
//
// ── ROUND 3: THE READERS OF THE SAME NAMES REFUSE A LINK TOO — A DECISION, NOT A DEFAULT ─────────────
//
// Rounds 1-2 guarded the writes and left every reader of these three names following a link:
// notes::readNotes, quality::readBaseline / readBaselineHeadSha / readBaselineAbsorbed, archReadBaseline,
// and a bare stream the arch verb opened only to learn whether the sidecar existed. So a link at one of the
// names still decided which file those readers opened, inside the tree or out of it, and its lines were read
// as sidecar records.
//
// No privilege is crossed; the user could read those files anyway. The boundary is the one the crawl already
// holds (ingest.h, withinCanonicalRoot): repository content does not choose which of the user's files the
// tool reads. Three answers were on the table, and the choice is pinned by the round-3 arms of
// test/sidecarsymlinkcheck.sh rather than left to whoever next edits a reader:
//
//   (a) Leave the readers following. REJECTED: a link would keep deciding what is read at three fixed names,
//       right beside a crawl that no longer lets one.
//   (c) Refuse only a link that leaves the crawl root, which is the crawl's own rule. REJECTED, three ways:
//       - It does not keep the setup that argues for it. A sidecar symlinked into a SHARED config directory
//         points outside the tree, and (c) refuses that as well. What (c) keeps beyond (b) is a link to
//         another file INSIDE the tree — which the writers already refuse, so it is readable and never
//         again updatable.
//       - It cannot be one syscall. "Where does the link lead" is realpath() followed by an open: the
//         check-then-open shape round 2 removed from the writers, or a descriptor-then-verify dance to close
//         that same race a second time.
//       - It has no single anchor. The arch baseline resolves against the process CWD (archBaselinePath),
//         not the crawl root, so "leaves the root" is not even defined for one of the three.
//   (b) Refuse a link on READ exactly as on write: O_NOFOLLOW at the open. CHOSEN. One sentence covers every
//       site — a sidecar is a regular file at its fixed name, read or written — and the kernel enforces it
//       in the very syscall that would otherwise have followed the link.
//
// The crawl follows an in-tree link and these readers do not, and that is not an inconsistency. A source
// tree's links are the user's content; a sidecar is this tool's own state file, which it never creates as
// a link and, since round 1, will not write through one. git draws the same line: since 2.32 it opens the
// in-tree .gitattributes, .gitignore and .mailmap with O_NOFOLLOW.
//
// MIGRATION. A repository that symlinks one of these sidecars on purpose now gets a stderr refusal on every
// read and no sidecar in force: no notes surface, quality-delta reports baseline="git-HEAD (symlinked
// sidecar refused)" and compares against HEAD, and the arch verb reports every violation as new. Replace
// the link with a regular copy of its target — copy the target to a temporary name beside the link, then
// mv that over the link — and if it must track a shared original, copy it in as a CI step instead.
//
// NOT COVERED, and why:
//   - `.ripwire_quality_acks` (readAckRecords). Its writer publishes by tmp+rename, which REPLACES a link
//     instead of following it, so what a refused read should make that writer do belongs to the lane that
//     guards the writer. The reader moves with it.
//   - `.ripwire_config` (readRegisterMacrosConfig). User-authored, never written by the tool, and the one
//     of these names where a link into a shared directory is the ordinary setup. Whether it takes this rule
//     is its own decision.
//   - An in-document disclosure where the document has no channel for one. The refusal reaches stderr from
//     every surface, and the document only where a marker already tells "no sidecar" from "a sidecar not
//     used" (quality-delta, CLI and MCP). A refused note is simply absent from --for, --expand and the MCP
//     verbs, and an MCP client never sees the server's stderr.
//   - Directory components. O_NOFOLLOW constrains the final component only, exactly as for the writes.
//
// Each sidecar keeps ONE read seam (readNotesSidecar / readBaselineSidecar / readArchBaselineSidecar) that
// calls openNoFollowRead below and carries its own DISCLOSE, for the same once-per-site reason the
// write seams keep theirs.
//
// ── ROUND 4: A NON-REGULAR FILE AT THE NAME, AND A READ THAT HOLDS ONE LINE ─────────────────────────────
//
// Two review findings on round 3, both confirmed before anything changed.
//
// A FIFO planted AT a sidecar name, with no link involved, blocked BOTH opens: a read open waits for a writer
// and a write open waits for a reader. It predates round 3 (the streams these descriptors replaced blocked the
// same way) and a git checkout cannot contain a FIFO, but a blocked open is still wrong, and fixing the reader
// alone would have been half a fix.
// So both opens carry O_NONBLOCK, which lets the open RETURN whatever sits at the name, and both then ask
// fstat whether it is a regular file before a byte moves. A writer refuses anything else, loudly, with nothing
// written. A reader treats it as a sidecar that is there but unreadable, which is what the stream it replaced
// reported for a directory at the name. O_NONBLOCK changes nothing about a regular file's reads or writes.
//
// The round-3 read also held the WHOLE file in memory before parsing began, where the std::ifstream it
// replaced held one line. The remedy is streaming, not a size cap: the crawl's --max-file-size is a ceiling
// for SOURCE files, and applying it here would refuse a legitimately large quality baseline, which is a wrong
// answer rather than a guard. The read now hands its caller one line at a time through POSIX getline over the
// descriptor's stream, which costs what the std::ifstream readers cost. Two other shapes were ruled out first:
// a call per byte (rw::readByteSafeLine's fgetc loop) measured ~15× slower on 64 MB of sidecar lines, and a
// custom std::streambuf under std::getline would narrow a high byte through libc++'s no-get-area fallback,
// which aborts the sanitizer build (src/infra/stdinline.h records that trap).
//
// It carries no index/graph dependency on purpose — the emitter and the degrade macro are the whole of it — so
// it stays includable from any layer, which is the property that let the rule be missing in the first place.
// It is NOT under src/infra/: that layer is vendored into a sibling repo and may not name this project
// (test/infraportcheck.sh rule (C)), and every sentence below has to.
//
// Gated by test/sidecarsymlinkcheck.sh, whose three symlink arms were observed RED before this header
// existed, whose (e)/(f) mechanism arms were observed RED before the open below replaced the check, whose

// Rounds 1-4 guarded the FINAL sidecar names (openNoFollowTruncate / openNoFollowRead). The three atomic

// final name only through a rename() of a TEMP file they open beside it. That temp is now created the same
// way the sidecar names are: as a fresh file, refusing an existing entry at the name.
//
// The rule is the CREATE, not a check in front of it (round 2's CWE-367 lesson): O_CREAT|O_EXCL means the
// kernel creates the file or fails — a symlink OR any existing file at the name yields EEXIST and is never
// opened, never followed, never truncated; O_NOFOLLOW is kept as belt-and-braces for the same intent;
// O_CLOEXEC keeps the descriptor out of any child git/tar. The name carries a CSPRNG-drawn suffix, so an
// existing entry at a candidate name does not block the write either — a fresh draw picks another and the
// loop retries a few times on EEXIST. The mode argument is each writer's HISTORICAL create mode (0644 for the
// mcpedit temp, which then fchmods to the edited file's own bits; 0666 for the two tool-state writers, whose
// ofstream / fopen requested exactly that), so the kernel applies the umask precisely as before and every
