#!/usr/bin/env bash
# situshapecheck.sh — --situ's DISCLOSURE SHAPE: every fact the report used to say in a sentence is said as
# an attribute, and nothing it disclosed has gone missing.
#
#   test/situshapecheck.sh
#   RIPWIRE_BIN=asan/ripwire test/situshapecheck.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. --situ is the mid-task report, and it is the one verb with no XML root to hang attributes
# on — so every disclosure it owed was written as prose, and the prose grew: the graph-count floor clause ran
# 601 B, the decl/def partner header 229 B, the tests-to-run header 267 B, and the script-gates caveat 152 B,
# on a report whose whole ANSWER (the [2] rows) is what the agent acts on. A byte attribution over the frozen
# question set (PLAN_OUTPUT_ROUTING_LOOP §1.2) put ~800 B per answer in those four sentences, repeated on every
# call, carrying facts a reader can only use if they are NAMED — which is what an attribute is.
#
# METHODOLOGY §9 is the rule this gate enforces: honesty lives in ATTRIBUTES, and a shortened sentence may not
# quietly drop a floor, a cap, or a caveat. So each arm below names ONE disclosure the prose carried and
# asserts the attribute form still carries it — by name, with a reading — plus a byte ratchet per line so the
# prose cannot creep back. test/floormarkcheck.sh keeps the two anchor phrases; this gate mirrors them, so a
# regression reds HERE too rather than only in a gate about a different property.
#
# THE BYTE TABLE — one number per line, one corpus, named here so nothing else has to restate it. Measured
# by this gate's own `${#line}` (characters), on THIS repo at `--situ=src/graph.h` except the partner header,
# which is measured on the fixture below at `--situ=core/widget.cc` (this repo has no decl/def partner for
# graph.h). The "before" column is what these same arms printed, red, against the pre-A5 binary:
#
#     line                     before   after   ratchet
#     graph-count floor          601      344     360
#     decl/def partner header    228      209     220
#     [2] tests-to-run header    267      220     230
#     script-gate disclosure     165*     132     140          (* derived from the pre-A5 literal with this
#                                                                corpus's count: the arm did not exist yet)
#
# The ratchets sit above the after values, not on them: this gate forbids the PARAGRAPH coming back, and a
# later lane adding one honest word to a reading should not have to move a pin to do it. Review of #219 moved
# the floor and partner ratchets UP (200 -> 360, 140 -> 220) when the readings those lines had dropped were
# restored — the reading is the disclosure, and a ratchet that forbids it is a ratchet aimed at the wrong thing.
#
# Exit 0 = ALL PASS, non-zero = SOME FAILED.
