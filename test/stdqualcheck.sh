# stdqualcheck.sh — gate for the std::-QUALIFIED C++ call scope guard (graph.h keepStdQualifiedCandidates).
#
# WHAT WAS BROKEN. A C++ call written `std::X( … )` looks up the canonical key `std::X` first. When no in-repo
# def is keyed that way — the normal case, because the def lives in the standard library — the site fell to the
# bare-name spray, and a LONE in-repo definition named X took it: any class's `move()`, `swap()`, `fill()`, at
# full confidence, with no amb= and no prov="split". Nothing splits a lone candidate, so nothing disclosed it.
# Found by a read-only probe of a large C++20 database engine: one header-only string wrapper declares a
# `move()` member, and ~2,100 caller functions' std::move sites bound to it, making that one-line accessor the
# top-ranked symbol of the whole tree. A 6-line reproduction gave --callers count=3.
#
# THE RULE. A call whose written qualifier is `std` — `std::X`, `::std::X`, or a standard library's inline ABI
# namespace spelling such as `std::__1::X` — may bind only a definition that is itself inside namespace std: a
# def scoped `std`, a member of a class written `std::…`, or a def in one of those inline namespaces. When none
# survives the site is refused and counted in the header's `external=`. It is std-ONLY, on purpose: any other
# qualifier can legitimately miss its def's scope (a namespace alias, a using-declaration, a derived-class
# qualifier), and §8's alias arm is the true edge a general rule would delete.
#
# THE CORPUS is test/stdqualfix/; each file's header maps its call spellings to the arm below. EVERY expected
# number is a LITERAL read off those files by hand, never derived the way the resolver derives it.
#
# RED-FIRST (recorded 2026-09-11, plain build of origin/main 3511c93b, before graph.h changed): 19 of the 35
# checks FAIL. The pre-fix readings, each the literal the matching arm now refuses:
#   header           edges=15 ambiguous=1 unresolved=0 external=2           (now edges=6 ambiguous=0 external=12)
#   --callers        Buf::move 4, Slot::swap 3, Cursor::unreachable 2      (now 1 / 1 / 1)
#   --callees        takeTwice takeRooted takeInline flipTwice flipRooted stopHere rotate clearHost = 1 each
#                    (now 0 each); launderIt 2, amb="1", one arm on arena.h's decoy (now 1, polyfill.h, no amb=)
#   census           takeTwice 2x 'unique' -> Buf::move, rotate 'receiver-rule' -> Token::exchange (now 'external');
#                    C external rows 2 (bareMove, bridgeMove)               (now 12)
# The 16 that pass on BOTH binaries are, by construction, the controls: the true member calls (useBuf, useSlot,
# clearGrid), the alias call, the unqualified veto, the ObjC++ floor, the specialization zero and its vacuity
# guard, the Rule-3 eligibility guard, the name-based --uses counts and the hygiene arms. They are what proves the
# guard took ONLY what it should.
#
# THE GUARD IS LOAD-BEARING, PART BY PART (manual mutations, each a scratch build of graph.h, measured 2026-09-11;
# 35/35 PASS on the unmutated binary):
#   M1  guard never applies (cppFamilyRef forced false)            19 FAIL — byte-for-byte the RED readings above
#   M2  call site passes `alreadyPinned` instead of `canonical`,     4 FAIL — --callees=rotate 1, rotate's census row
#       i.e. a Rule-3-narrowed site is exempt (the Rust shape)       'receiver-rule', header edges=7 external=11, census 11
#   M3  inline ABI namespaces ignored (only a literal `std` counts)   4 FAIL — --callers=Buf::move 2 (std::__1::move binds
#                                                                    again), --callees=takeInline 1, launderIt 0 (the def

# M3 leaves the header at edges=6 external=12 — one edge swaps for one refusal — so only the per-function arms
# catch it. Keep them; the totals alone cannot.
#
# §11 (added 2026-09-11, FIXED 2026-09-23 by #150) covers nested std namespaces and declaration-only std defs,
# on a corpus this gate writes into $TMP; its own RED-FIRST evidence is recorded next to §11 itself, below. The
# 35-check counts above are #134's and do not include §11. §12 (added 2026-09-23) extends #150's coverage to
# the additional written shapes the fix's own design has to get right (`::std::`, an inline ABI namespace above
# a nested one, the C++17 `namespace std::ranges { … }` spelling, a namespace literally named `std` nested
# inside another, and `using namespace std::chrono;` — RED-FIRST evidence at §12 itself) plus `--callers`,
# `--impact` and `--dead-code` over the SAME §11 fixture, so the fix's effect on every verb `--quality-delta`
# and the other navigation verbs read is pinned, not just `--callees`.

# ── §11 NESTED std NAMESPACES (#150, fixed) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Was a KNOWN GAP section for prompts/help-wanted/cpp-nested-std-namespaces.md, pinning three wrong answers
# (K1-K3 below) that PASSED on every pre-#150 binary. #150 widened keepStdQualifiedCandidates (graph.h) to read
# the FULL written qualifier chain (Reference::qualifierRootsStd / Symbol::scopeRootsStd, computed at extraction
# by ingest_names.h cppQualifiedChainRootsStd/cppEnclosingChainRootsStd/cppDefinitionRootsStd), not just the
# immediate segment #134 read — the arms below now assert the CORRECTED literals (count=0, one 'external' census
# row each) and the RED evidence (the pre-#150 wrong answers) is recorded in this section's own history comment
# below. The CONTROL arms hold on both binaries; they are what proves the fix took only what it should.
#
# WHY THIS FIXTURE IS WRITTEN AT RUN TIME into $TMP instead of committed beside test/stdqualfix. ripwire's own
# tracked sources call these names, so a committed decoy is not inert. Measured 2026-09-11 with a temporary,
# uncommitted copy of these four files under test/: --callers=duration_cast on the whole repo counted 7, among them
# ripwire's own now_ticks (src/infra/profileScope.h) and wallClockNs (src/ingest_crawl.h), whose
# std::chrono::duration_cast calls bound to the decoy by exactly gap K2 below. The decoy move and the
# declaration-only std::terminate took no caller outside the fixture in that run. A committed copy would plant K2's
# false edges in ripwire's own map and move every live-tree capture that reads them. A heredoc is as literal as a
# committed file, and invisible to the self-crawl.
#
# THE THREE GAPS — RED-FIRST EVIDENCE, measured 2026-09-11 on a plain build of main 766913d0, and reconfirmed
# 2026-09-23 on origin/main 60b65f02 (pre-#150) before this fix (census mech in quotes):
#   K1  std::ranges::move( from, to.begin() ) in shiftRange. The call arrives with qualifier "ranges", the IMMEDIATE
#       segment, which cannot be told from a user namespace; the guard never applies and the bare-name spray hands
#       the site to the LONE in-repo move, Pool::move ('unique'). #134 left exactly this shape as the one false
#       caller of the large engine's SafeString::move.
#   K2  std::chrono::duration_cast<…>( s ) in toMillis. Worse than K1: the canonical key chrono::duration_cast HITS a
#       user namespace that mirrors std's layout (vendorlib::chrono; Boost.Chrono's boost::chrono::duration_cast is
#       the real-world twin), and a canonical hit is exempt from the guard by design ('qualified', no amb=).
#   K3  std::terminate() in bail, against compat.h's DECLARATION-ONLY `namespace std { void terminate() noexcept; }`.
#       The guard keeps the candidate because its scope is std; nothing in the corpus defines it ('unique').
# On the #150 FIX (this binary): K1/K2/K3 all refuse (count=0, one 'external' census row each, header
# edges=3 external=3 — was edges=6, no external=). CONTROLS, held on BOTH binaries — proof the fix took only
# what it should: drain's pool.move() -> Pool::move (a true member call); sampleTicks' vendorlib::chrono::
# duration_cast -> the SAME def K2 wrongly took, kept because the chain root is "vendorlib", not "std" (a fix
# must read the WHOLE chain, not refuse every chrono::); hasAnswer's std::ranges::contains -> a def INSIDE
# std::ranges (a polyfill), which the std-rooted rule keeps because ITS OWN chain is std-rooted too.

# ── §14 (F1/F2, adversarial review of #150, 2026-09-23) — OUT-OF-LINE std DEFINITIONS, 3+ SEGMENTS ─────────
# The review that found this: cppDefinitionRootsStd (ingest_names.h) trusted `ts_node_parent(nameNode)` to
# always be the OUTERMOST qualified_identifier of a definition's written chain, the way it genuinely is for a
# CALL. It is not, for a 3+-segment OUT-OF-LINE DEFINITION: ingest.cpp re-seats a definition's @name to the
# INNERMOST link (queries/cpp/tags.scm's own comment: "ingest.cpp descends it to the innermost name:"), so
# `std::detail::f`'s nameNode there is `f`, whose immediate parent is only the inner `detail::f` node — its
# root reads as "detail", not "std", and a real std-rooted definition loses every true caller (RED on lane
# head 70dfdf09, BEFORE this fix: `test/stdqualcheck.sh` itself passed ALL PASS at that commit, because §11's
# fixture has no 3+-segment out-of-line std definition — these three shapes are what a probe build had to
# add to find it). A second, narrower bug shared the same root cause: a PARTIALLY-qualified out-of-line def
# written inside `namespace std { … }` (`namespace std { int detail::innerHelper(int){} }`) never reached the
# enclosing-namespace fallback at all, qualified or not. §14 also covers F2: the K3 "must have a body" filter
# (graph.h) applied to every candidate kind, including a std-rooted VARIABLE (a niebloid), which has no
# separate body by construction and was wrongly refused as if it were a bodyless declaration.

# std::ranges::vshift(int)` written inside `namespace vendor { … }` defines vendor::std::ranges::vshift. The

# std-rooted from its written chain alone, and keepStdQualifiedCandidates then kept it as the target of a call
# to the real ::std::ranges::vshift, which has no in-repo definition: RED on 9936ba4e, count=1 for both calls
# below (a false edge). §14's file-scope out-of-line std defs above are the control: they must still resolve.
# Known limit, the SAFE direction #150 already chose: a call written `std::ranges::vshift` INSIDE namespace
# vendor (which C++ would bind to vendor::std) is not bound either, since the call side cannot tell vendor::std
# from ::std without cross-file lookup; an unbound call is disclosed, a false edge is not.
