#!/usr/bin/env bash
# auditregresscheck.sh — the INTEGRATION gate for spec security-regression-integration (v1.1.0): the five
# 2026-09-14 audit reproductions replayed end-to-end against the REAL binary, both transports, plus the
# suite invariants that must survive the composition.
#
# WHY (the closed loop this file closes). Each of the five fixes has its own unit gate, and each passed. What
# no unit gate can say is whether the five compose in one binary: whether the regex screen still refuses on
# the CLI, whether the edit pin still refuses on the tiers it pins, whether the atomic publish still ignores a
# planted temp name, whether hostile git paths still attribute to their real author, and whether each
# transport still refuses past ITS OWN bound and then keeps serving. This gate asserts exactly that, and
# nothing else. Integration specs produce verification, not features: this lane touches zero src/ files.
#
# FOUR THINGS THIS GATE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO, each for a measured reason (Phase 0, 2026-11-06):
#
#  1. It does NOT assert a regex REFUSAL over MCP. No MCP verb takes a regex at all: `grep` is literal-only
#     (src/mcpverbs.h:1324 `/*regex=*/false`), and no wire field in the MCP surface matches "regex". So the
#     HTTP leg asserts the TRANSPORT-SAFETY fact instead — a bomb-shaped pattern answers a structured empty
#     (files=0 total=0 complete=true), the server stays responsive, and a POSITIVE CONTROL proves the tree
#     really was scanned. Without that control an empty answer is indistinguishable from a dead scan.
#
#  2. It does NOT arm the bare-stdio edit escape. `ripwire --mcp` with no startup root runs the assumedRoot
#     tier, which the edit pin's own gate (src/mcp.h:1944, `!policy.defaultRoot.empty()`) never enters; an
#     off-workspace edit SUCCEEDS there. That is SRI-F1 (findings/stdio-bare-edit-escape.md), red at base and
#     reproduced by both seats — a proposed unit spec, NOT this lane's arm. A permanently red row is an issue
#     tracker, not a gate. The PINNED tiers (startup-root stdio, HTTP with and without --allow-remote-edits)
#     are asserted here, because those are the tiers the shipped contract pins.
#
#  3. It does NOT conflate the two caps. They are different constants on different transports:
#     HTTP  kMaxBodyBytes         = 8 MiB  (src/mcpserver.h:60)  -> 413 "request body exceeds the 8 MB limit"
#     stdio kMcpStdioLineMaxBytes = 32 MiB (src/mcp.h:3009)      -> -32600 "request line exceeds the
#                                                                        33554432-byte limit"
#     A 9 MiB STDIO LINE IS INSIDE THE SHIPPED BOUND: it is served, correctly, and is therefore NOT an attack
#     row. Arms A5h (HTTP at cap+1) and A5s (stdio past 32 MiB) each assert one error + one healthy follow-up
#     at ITS OWN bound.
#
#  4. It does NOT assert "pargates green" from inside itself. test/pargates.py runs EVERY top-level test/*.sh,
#     this file included, so a gate that ran pargates would re-enter itself without bound. The suite-level
#     oracle for that property is the suite run itself; arm B asserts what a gate CAN own — determinism and
#     XML well-formedness over the adversarial fixture — and SKIPS the two legs it cannot own (pargates,
#     ASan) with a disclosure naming why, rather than pretending.
#
# A3 IS A REGRESSION GUARD, NOT A LIVE ATTACK. The shipped temp name is 24 hex chars drawn from /dev/urandom
# and created O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW with 8 EEXIST retries (src/pathguard.h:361-410,507-523), so no name can be
# pre-planted from outside; test/tempfilesymlinkcheck.sh owns the live half and says so in its own header.
# What this arm pins is that the HISTORICAL predictable shapes stay dead, that the edit still publishes, and
# that no temp residue is left behind.
#
# EVERY PATH THIS GATE SENDS IS ABSOLUTE, and every stdio child runs with cwd set to the tree it is being
# asked about. A relative `path` resolves against the CHILD's cwd, so an arm that says "." from the repo root
# is asking about the repo, not about its fixture — a distinction that made an earlier draft of arm A2a pass
# for the wrong reason (refused as "outside", but never aimed at the victim at all).
#
# A1's discriminator is the LEAD-IN, not the verdict word: `refused, nothing was scanned:` is the structural
# screen (verbs_grep.h:998), while `refused, no hit is reported:` is an abandonment (verbs_grep.h:906). Exit
# status, the bare word `refused`, and `catastrophic backtracking` are all unusable as discriminators.
