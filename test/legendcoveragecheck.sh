# legendcoveragecheck.sh — THE FIRST-SCREEN LEGEND-COVERAGE RATCHET (capture-audit-4, §B7 lane).
#
# Why this gate exists. Every round of this audit has re-found the same shape: an attribute or marker string
# a reader meets on the first screen with NO definition where they meet it. §B7.8 alone was found in some
# form in eight consecutive rounds. Each time it was found by a human reading output; each time the fix
# closed one attribute and the class stayed open. This gate closes the CLASS by making it mechanical.
#
# What it measures. For every verb in the roster below: run it, split the LEADING comment block (the legend
# the reader actually meets first) from the document, enumerate the attribute names on the root element and
# on the first instance of EVERY distinct child element, and report which of those names the legend fails to
# define.
#
# TWO PREDICATES, ONE PER ARM — and this is the whole design, so read it before editing either.
# The gate makes two DIFFERENT claims, and they are negations of each other, so a single predicate is
# conservative in one and reckless in the other:
#
#   (A) "here is a NEW gap"    -> FAILS the suite. Being wrong here is a false alarm, so (A) uses the
#       GENEROUS predicate `mentioned`: an attribute counts as covered if its bare name appears anywhere in
#       the legend, in any form. A gap (A) reports is therefore real — the legend does not contain the word.
#   (B) "this gap is CLOSED"   -> instructs a future agent to delete a line from the ratchet FLOOR. Being
#       wrong here silently DISCARDS recorded debt, so (B) uses the DEFINITIONAL predicate `defined`: the
#       attribute name immediately followed by `=`, which is the house convention every legend in this tree
#       already uses (`churn=commits touching the file`, `at= is the git commit`, `files= is the indexed
#       corpus`). A closure (B) reports is therefore real — the legend really defines the attribute.
#
# So the gate UNDER-reports in BOTH directions and over-reports in NEITHER. That symmetry is the fix for
# CA4-F5.F1: the header used to disclose the generosity cost for arm (A) only — "it never over-reports" —
# while arm (B), the negation of the same predicate, inherited the OPPOSITE error undisclosed. Live proof
# it was not theoretical: (B) reported `edit-check | edit-check@at` as closed because §B11.3's sentence
# contains the English word — "defs= is how many DEFINITIONS *at* this site" — while `at=`, the git stamp,
# is still undefined on --edit-check's first screen, and test/legendcoverage_baseline.txt:36-38, committed
# by the same lane in the same wave, says so correctly in prose. Same shape on `stray-content@head` ("only
# the checked out one has a local head") and `test-gate@impacted` ("untested= here counts impacted SYMBOLS").
# Short attribute names that are also English words — at, in, of, k, p, n, head, total — cannot be settled
# by a bare word-boundary search, and they are exactly the ones this audit keeps re-finding.
#
# The residual, stated rather than discovered later. Between the two predicates sits a GREY ZONE: an
# attribute the legend discusses in prose but never spells `name=` (`of_top denominator is per-section`).
# Those are not failed by (A) and not credited by (B); the count is printed as INFO so the class is visible
# without either arm asserting on it, and LEGENDCOV_LIST=1 lists them. The residual OF THE RESIDUAL, measured
# by mutation rather than reasoned about: a baseline line in the grey zone is not protected by (A) either —
# deleting `edit-check | edit-check@at` from the floor by hand leaves the gate green, because (A) asks the
# generous question and the word is there. What the fix buys is that the gate no longer TELLS anyone to
# delete it, which is the failure mode F1 recorded. Deleting a grey-zone line is a review question, not a
# gate question, and the baseline header names the three that are in it.
#
# NO CAP. The enumeration used to stop at the first six distinct element tags (`if len(order) >= 6: break`)
# with no header disclosing it, which is CA4-F5.F2: it hid 8 real gaps, and two of them were §B8.3 verbatim
# — --pack-task emits `<bodies shown="4" total="6" capped="1">` as its 8th distinct tag, and its legend
# contained the words `shown` and `total` zero times. Removing the cap took the live count 146 -> 154. The
# cap bought nothing measurable: the regex already walks the whole document either way.
#
# The RATCHET. test/legendcoverage_baseline.txt records the gaps that exist today, one "verb | element@attr"
# per line. This gate FAILS on any gap NOT in that file — i.e. a NEW undefined attribute cannot be added to
# any first screen without a red gate naming it. Gaps that have been CLOSED are printed as shrink candidates
# with the exact lines to delete; they are not a failure, because a verb that emits fewer rows in a different
# environment would otherwise flake. Arm (B) splits them by CAUSE, because the two need different evidence:
# a line closed because the legend now DEFINES the attribute is deleted with that legend text, and a line
# closed because the verb no longer EMITS the attribute has no legend text to cite. The baseline may only be
# edited DOWNWARD; the one exception on record is the F2 re-derivation above, which widened the WINDOW rather
# than the debt, and it is annotated in the baseline header.
#
# ELEMENT-BLINDNESS — the limit this gate cannot assert away, named where a reader meets it (CONTRIBUTING §2
# shape 7: a gate whose NAME promises more than its CODE delivers is fixed by asserting the missing property,
# or, where that is impossible, by naming the limit). Both predicates take an attribute NAME and a legend
# STRING. Neither knows which ELEMENT the attribute was on. So a document carrying `total=` on two elements
# has ONE coverage verdict for both, and a clause written about one of them credits the other. That is live
# and measured, not hypothetical: `<sigs total= shown= capped=>` is defined by the bundle=auto/compact legend
# and `<tail total= shown= capped=>` by the tail legend, and on every --for row in this roster — before the
# 0.6.1 rung-zero lane and independently of it — whichever of those two clauses is present closes BOTH
# elements' trios. Consequence to hold on to: a baseline line naming one of a SHARED name can be closed by a
# clause written for the other element, so `sigs@total` has never been separately visible here. Closing that
# needs an element-aware predicate (the legends would have to name the element, which most do not), which is
# a change to the contract rather than to this gate. Until then the limit is not merely written down: arm (F)
# CENSUSES it — every key whose only definition is the rung-zero note under a name the same document carries
# twice is printed on every run and pinned, so a future clause drop that a shared name papers over reds here
# instead of arriving as a quieter baseline.
#
# "What would make this pass without the property holding?" (the round's own lens, trap #20). Three things,
# not one — the earlier "Exactly one thing" was wrong, and the cap above was the second. (i) a roster verb
# that stops producing output has no elements, no attributes and no gaps: arm (C) names every silent verb
# and fails. (ii) the two predicates drifting apart so that `mentioned` stops being the weaker of the two,
# which would make (A) fail on something (B) had just called closed: arm (D) asserts they still nest.
# (iii) a legend that CLOSES ITS OWN GAPS by naming attributes nothing defines — the shape rung zero's
# dropped-legend note has by construction, since it spells every name it discloses as `name=`: arm (E)
# re-asks each of those names against the same query at a budget where no clause was dropped, and arm (F)
# pins which of those closures land on a name the document carries on more than one element.

# L1 (round 1 of the answer-size loop, 2026-09-19): THE CLI DEFAULT BECAME COMPACT, so a roster row that names no
# posture would silently have become a compact row and the FULL dialect — every row this ratchet has ever recorded,
# test/legendcoverage_baseline.txt line for line — would have lost its ratchet. So every row above is re-spelled as a
# FULL row (the name unchanged, `--legend=full` appended: the baseline's lines keep meaning exactly what they meant,
# and that file did not gain a line), and gets a DEFAULT TWIN, `<name>-default`, run with no posture flag at all —
# whatever the default is today (compact) and whatever round 2 makes it.
# THE DEFAULT TWINS HAVE NO FLOOR (L1 fix round, rv-r1-L1 HIGH-1). L1 seeded one — 269 "<row>-default" lines, called
# descriptive attributes the compact dialect "leaves to --legend=full" — and ~25 of them were cut/floor/cap terms
# (renames_window_truncated=, script_gates_unmodelled=, more files=, hcut=/rcut= …): the ratchet RATIFIED the gap instead
# of closing it. Owner ruling: compact shortens the dictionary, never a meaning, so the default answer defines every
# attribute it emits. Arm (G) below holds that with the DEFINITIONAL predicate (`name=`, arm (B)'s), not the generous
# one, and with an empty floor: a default first screen that emits one attribute its own legend does not define fails.
# Two kinds of row keep their spelling: a row that already names a posture (the *-compact rows, whose own lines stay theirs), and a run with
# no XML legend (--report), which refuses an ASKED posture and has no default twin to take.

# (E) A DROPPED-LEGEND NOTE MAY ONLY NAME ATTRIBUTES ITS OWN DIALECT REALLY DEFINED (0.6.1, the L1 lane).
#
# The roster above answers "is this attribute defined here?". It cannot answer the question rung zero
# introduced, which is the opposite one: the ceiling ladder's rung zero DROPS legend clauses and splices a
# sentence naming the attributes whose definitions just went (verbs_for.h kForLegendDroppedNote). That
# sentence is the ONE place a budgeted reader is told where a definition went, and it is self-defeating in
# two ways the roster is blind to:
#
#   (i)  it spells each name as `name=`, which is the roster's own `defined` shape — so the note closes its
#        own gaps, and arm (A) goes green on the very run where the legend was cut. A note naming an
#        attribute nothing ever defined would look exactly like a note that told the truth.
#   (ii) the two dialects do not carry the same clauses. `--legend=compact` never defined budget_tokens= or
#        max_tokens= at all, so telling a compact reader those were "dropped (ceiling)" is a false statement
#        about a missing feature — the precise confusion the note exists to prevent.
#
# THE ASSERTION, which needs no knowledge of which clause holds which name: run the SAME query in the SAME
# dialect at a budget wide enough that no rung fires, and require that every `name=` the note spelled is
# defined there. A definition that comes back when the budget is lifted was dropped by the ceiling; one that
# does not was never in that dialect, and the note is claiming a cut that never happened. Both guards that
# keep this from passing emptily are asserted, not assumed: the note must be PRESENT on the tight run (else
# the probe budget has drifted off the rung) and ABSENT on the wide one (else "wider" proves nothing).
# (F) …and the census that keeps ELEMENT-BLINDNESS from turning into a silent closure. Rung zero's note spells
# `total= shown= capped=` about the <tail>, and the budgeted document carries those same three names on <sigs>
# too, whose own clause (the bundle=auto/compact legend) the enrichment's `legendOff` dropped independently. The
# predicate cannot tell the two apart, so the note closes six keys while describing three. That is not this
# note's doing — measured on the base binary, whichever of the two clauses survives closes BOTH elements' trios
# on every other --for row, so the pair has never been separately visible — but it must not be invisible either.
# So the exact set is PINNED below, printed on every run, and a key ENTERING it fails: the next time a legend
# clause is dropped somewhere and a shared name papers over it, the census names the key. A key LEAVING is a
# shrink candidate, not a failure (arm (B)'s discipline: the budgeted document's shape moves with the corpus).
