#!/usr/bin/env bash
# regexguardcheck.sh — src/regexguard.h is THE owner of every user-authored regular expression, and this gate
# is what keeps it the only one.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `--regex` was protected: src/search.h screened the pattern structurally (non-portable
# escapes, the nested-quantifier backtracking family) and refused it by name before either standard library's
# engine saw it (test/regexbombcheck.sh). Three other entry points hand a user's pattern to the same engine and
# skipped that screen, and none of them guarded the MATCH either:
#
#     ripwire rx --graph-query='file(all,"(a+)+z")'          rc=134  libc++abi: uncaught std::regex_error
#     ripwire rx --arch=rules   (deny path zz/.* -> (a+)+z)   rc=134  same abort
#     ripwire rx --match='… (#match? @id "(a+)+z")'           rc=0    the throw was swallowed: a row the
#                                                                     predicate never decided is KEPT
#
# (Apple libc++, whose engine throws error_complexity; on libstdc++, which has no budget, the same calls
# backtrack without end.) And `file()` matched the path WITH the checkout directory in front of it, so
# `file(all,"alpha")` selected every symbol in a clone named `repo_alpha` and none in `repo_beta` — an answer
# decided by where the tree was cloned, which --arch fixed for its own rules long ago and --graph-query never
# got.
#
# ARMS
#   (a) SCREEN AT EVERY ENTRY POINT — a catastrophic pattern through --graph-query file(), an --arch path-rule
#       (FROM and TO), a --match #match? predicate, a --lint-rules #match? predicate and --regex is REFUSED:
#       exit 1, bounded time, never a signal death, the pattern and the construct named on stderr. Each entry
#       point also has a POSITIVE CONTROL: an ordinary pattern on the same fixture still answers.
#   (b) MATCH-TIME EXHAUSTION IS DISCLOSED, NEVER SILENT — the screen is a static approximation (overlapping
#       alternation like (a|a)+z is a real bomb it cannot see), so a regex_error thrown DURING a match must
#       refuse the answer by name rather than abort or report a count the engine never finished measuring.
#       (b1) is portable: the non-NDEBUG fault switch RIPWIRE_FAULT_REGEX_MATCH=1 makes every guarded match
#       throw, on every standard library, and each entry point must refuse. The flavour is ASKED of the binary
#       with a sibling fault switch whose alert is independent of this seam (prcontextcheck's idiom), so a
#       Release build reports the arm unobservable instead of passing or failing it for a switch it compiled
#       out. (b2) drives the REAL engine with (a|a)+z where the binary links libc++, whose engine abandons
#       that match; libstdc++ has no budget and would hang, which is the documented gap, not asserted.
#   (c) STATIC — no std::regex construction, match, iterator, result type or <regex> include in src/ outside
#       src/regexguard.h, over source with comments and string literals blanked (so the words in prose do not
#       count). The allowlist carries a reason per row, a stale row FAILS, and the detector is proved on a
#       planted file (fires) and on a planted clean file (silent) before its verdict on the tree is believed. The
#       allowlist is EMPTY since src/redact.h stopped spelling the engine (arm (o)).
#   (e) AN --arch TO PATTERN THAT ONLY FAILS AFTER SUBSTITUTION IS REFUSED, NOT INERT — `a{2,\1}` is a well-formed
#       template that passes the screen, and on an edge whose FROM captured "1" it becomes `a{2,1}`, an invalid
#       interval on every standard library. That rule used to be skipped silently for the edge (exit 0, violations
#       unreported); it must refuse by name, quoting the substituted text, with the other edges' rules still judged.
#   (f) THE SKILL SCANNER READS UNTRUSTED FILES, so its constant patterns go through the same boundary: (f1) the
#       linear EXFILTRATE:net-exfil decision agrees line for line with the regex it replaced, over generated lines
#       judged by an independent oracle (python's re, with `.` spelled [^\r\n] as ECMAScript reads it); (f2) a 200,000-byte
#       fenced `curl curl …` line scans in bounded time (the regex was quadratic: >60 s); (f3) an abandoned match
#       fails CLOSED — a CRITICAL SCAN-INCOMPLETE:regex-abandoned finding at exit 2, never a clean exit 0 and never an
#       abort inside wrap's noexcept scan.
#   (g) THE STACK BOUND — std::regex compiles by recursion, and a 20,000-byte literal --regex died with SIGBUS in a
#       512 KiB grep worker. A pattern over kRegexMaxPatternBytes (2,048) or nesting groups deeper than
#       kRegexMaxGroupDepth (64) is refused by name; exactly at each limit it still compiles.
#   (h) AN UNDECIDED #match? SAYS WHY — a capture-typed `(#match? @f @s)` compiles each match's own text, and three
#       different things can stop it: the screen refuses the captured text, the text does not compile, or the engine
#       abandons the match. One counter and one sentence ("the regex engine abandoned the match") used to cover all
#       three. Each cause now has its own run, fixture and wording; the refusal names the FIRST site (lowest file, then
#       byte) with the captured text, is byte-identical run to run, and --lint-rules says the same.
#   (i) --arch DECIDES DENY FIRST — an allow whose pattern the engine cannot finish must not turn a determinable "no
#       deny can forbid this edge" into a refusal; an undecided allow matters only when a deny fires and no allow
#       matches, and a later allow that matches still permits the edge.
#   (j) THE LITERAL PATHS ARE THE ENGINE — src/regexguard.h answers a literal (or `|`-joined literals, one optionally
#       `^`/`$`-anchored) with byte kernels, and never hands the engine a line holding none of a pattern's required
#       literals. test/regexlines_harness.cpp diffs both, and the long-line skip policy, against std::regex itself over
#       adversarial, generated and corpus patterns (every --regex the docs/skills/gates spell, every #match? a query or
#       lint pack carries) × CRLF/LF/empty-line texts, under both syntax sets; 0 mismatches and its coverage floors, and
#       a mutated copy of the header (an alternation that resumes one byte past a match) must go red.
#   (k) A LONG LINE ANSWERS OR SAYS IT WAS SKIPPED — libstdc++'s matcher recurses once per state it visits, and
#       `--regex='a*b'` died with SIGSEGV on a ~26–45 KB matching line on Linux. A 300 KB matching line now exits 0: matched
#       in full where the engine does not recurse (libc++), or skipped and disclosed (regex_lines_skipped=, regex_line_max=,
#       counts_floor, the LONG LINES legend clause) where it does. A 2 MB line with no 'b' is ruled out by the required
#       literal on every engine (it crashed libstdc++ and ran quadratic on libc++), a literal alternation over a 3 MB line
#       never reaches the engine, and a literal --grep answer is unchanged.
#   (l) THE BOUND HOLDS WHERE IT EXISTS — on a recursing engine, for three shapes (a plain repeat, an alternation loop, a
#       loop before a lookahead), a line of exactly regex_line_max bytes is matched at exit 0 and one byte more is skipped.
#   (m) THE SKIP PATH ON EVERY ENGINE — the non-NDEBUG fault switch RIPWIRE_FAULT_REGEX_LINE_BOUND=1 caps the bound at 64
#       bytes: a 104-byte line is skipped, counted and floored, and the compact legend reads both attributes; a literal
#       pattern and a line lacking the required literal are never skipped; the exact-"1" control changes nothing.
#   (n) ONE STACK FOR THE WHOLE SCAN — the scan threads settle one size (the smallest any got) before a single file is
#       read, so no file's skip-or-match depends on which thread took it. The fault switch RIPWIRE_FAULT_SCAN_STACK_MIXED=1
#       gives odd threads half the stack; with RIPWIRE_FAULT_REGEX_LINE_BOUND=1 (bound = stack >> 22) 48 files of a 50-byte
#       line are then all skipped at regex_line_max 32, five runs byte-identical, and regex_stack_bytes= discloses the
#       smaller stack even at 0 skips. The per-thread bound this replaced skipped 24-27 of the 48, varying run to run.
#   (o) REDACTION HAS NO ENGINE TO OVERFLOW — src/redact.h's nine prefixed rules are matched structurally;
#       test/redactshape_harness.cpp diffs each against its own table regex (0 mismatches, every rule matched), a mutated
#       threshold goes red, and --expand over a file holding "sk-" and a 200 KB token run exits 0 with the key redacted
#       (libstdc++'s regex overflowed the stack on it).
#   (d) file() IS ROOT-RELATIVE — two clones of one tree at different directory names, each run with an
#       absolute and a relative root spelling, must give the SAME count for a pattern naming one clone's
#       directory, and an anchored `^src/` must select the src/ symbols (it selected nothing under an
#       absolute root, because the path began with the checkout's own directories).
