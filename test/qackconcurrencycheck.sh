# qackconcurrencycheck.sh — round-4 finding F-04: `.ripwire_quality_acks` under CONCURRENT writers.
#
# WHAT BROKE. `--quality-ack` is a read-modify-write over the WHOLE ledger — read every existing row, heal
# the identities, fold in this run's accepted findings, rewrite the file from the in-memory map — and nothing
# serialized it. Three sessions acking DISJOINT rows in one shared checkout (different directory, different
# --scope, different --ack-only selector, so no legitimate conflict) is the exact scenario --scope exists for:
# "N agent sessions sharing one checkout". Measured before the fix on this fixture: 8 of 8 runs kept exactly
# ONE writer's acks and silently discarded the other two — not a partial merge, a full overwrite — and 1 of 8
# additionally left a torn line in the ledger, because the `ofstream(trunc)` rewrite was itself racing.
#
# WHAT THIS GATE ASSERTS:
#   (1) all THREE writers' acks survive every concurrent run, identified by the by=<scope> provenance stamp
#       each --scope run writes, and each writer's own selected row is present;
#   (2) the ledger PARSES after every run — every non-comment line matches the documented ack grammar, which
#       is what catches the torn-write half (a stray single-character line passes no grammar);
#   (3) no leftover tmp file from the atomic publish, and NO LOCK LITTER IN THE REPO: the lock lives in the
#       per-user cache dir, not as a `<ledger>.lock` sidecar next to a committed file (the A3-F8 rule the MCP
#       edit lock already learned — a sidecar lockfile is permanent git-status noise);
#   (4) the SINGLE-writer path is unchanged: two identical single-writer acks from the same start state
#       produce byte-identical ledgers, and the file the concurrent runs converge on is the same one three
#       sequential runs produce. The lock and the tmp+rename publish must not move a single byte of the
#       uncontended output — qackorigincheck/ackonlycheck pin the row CONTENT; this pins the bytes.
#   (8) RE-SCORE PROVENANCE (round 2026-09-22): a magnitude-bearing ack row carries `now=`/`was=` — the exact
#       (was,now) pair that decided its severity — and a facet-driven kind (duplication /
#       new-clone-of-reused-helper) additionally carries `facet=`. RED on the pre-provenance binary: neither
#       token existed, so this arm fails there by construction. The "table-driven re-score formula agrees with
#       the live one" half of the contract is proven a different way — not by this shell script re-deriving the
#       materiality formula, but by an ENSURES self-check wired into the write path itself (verbs_quality.h,
#       right after `rec` is built): every `--quality-ack` on a magnitude-bearing finding calls rescoreAckRecord
#       on the row it just wrote (in memory — NOT through renderAckRecords/readAckRecords, so it does not prove
#       the ledger's text grammar round-trips; that half is this arm's own grep checks below plus arms (2)/(7))
#       and ENSURES the verdict matches the one the live report just computed. That check runs on every ack this
#       gate's own fixtures take (arms 1-7 above, and 8 below) in the plain (non-NDEBUG) build — a divergence
#       would abort the process, which this arm's plain 0-exit check therefore also covers.
#
#   (9) THE LEGACY-ACK BACKFILL (round 2026-09-22): a row written before provenance existed carries none, and
#       for the two CLONE kinds it does not have to stay that way — their ack identity is the member-set hash,
#       so the idiom verdict is recomputable from the CURRENT tree. A stripped-back (legacy) clone row must
#       come back carrying `prov=recon` and its idiom; the pass must be idempotent; a LIVE ack of the same
#       finding must outrank the reconstruction and clear `prov=`; and a legacy NUMERIC row must be left alone,
#       because nothing in this tree can supply its `was=` and half a triple is worse than none. RED on the
#       pre-backfill binary, which leaves every stripped row legacy.
#
#   (10) LEDGER TOKENS ARE EXTERNAL INPUT (train 17 fix round): the ledger is committed and hand-edited, so a
#       now=/was= or p= line number a binary could not have written — negative, or past 32 bits — must stay
#       visible text, never be narrowed into a fabricated value (now=-1 read back as 4294967295, now=4294967296
#       as 0). And a finding whose path contains a SPACE must not have its locator written as a token it cannot
#       be read back as: `p=my dir/a b.py:1` read back as path `my`, the rest pushed into the reason, and the
#       next ack committed the damage. RED on the 0d6f0490 binary on both halves.
#
# Every arm was run RED against the pre-fix binary before the fix landed (arms 1 and 4's convergence arm; 8
# against the pre-provenance binary, which writes no now=/was=/facet= token at all; 9 against the
# pre-backfill binary, which heals no legacy row).
#

# ── (9) THE LEGACY-ACK BACKFILL ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A row written before provenance existed carries no now=/was=/facet=, so the knob sweep cannot re-score it.
# For the two CLONE kinds it does not have to stay that way: their ack identity IS the member-set hash, so a
# later run can recompute the idiom verdict from the CURRENT tree and heal the row — marked prov=recon,
# because "what the idiom is now" is a weaker claim than "what was measured when it was accepted".
#
# The only way to MAKE a legacy row here is to strip the tokens back off, because every binary under test
# writes them. That is a hand-edit of a FIXTURE ledger in a throwaway temp repo, never of the committed one
# (which is a build product and is only ever healed through the binary — quality.h's backfill note).
#
# Four things are asserted, and the last two are the honesty half rather than the feature half:
#   a) a stripped clone row comes BACK with prov=recon and its idiom — RED on the pre-backfill binary, which
#      leaves it legacy;
#   b) the pass is IDEMPOTENT — a second --quality-ack over the healed ledger moves zero bytes;
#   c) MEASURED BEATS RECONSTRUCTED — when the finding actually re-fires (its ratchet floor is dropped so it
#      is no longer suppressed) the live fold overwrites the reconstruction and prov= goes away. The backfill
#      runs BEFORE the fold, so ordering is what guarantees this rather than a check inside the backfill;
#   d) a stripped NUMERIC row is never given a reconstructed was= — nothing in this tree can supply one, and
#      inventing it is exactly the guess the honesty contract forbids. This is why the clone kinds are
#      healable and the numeric kinds are not, asserted rather than asserted-in-a-comment;
#   f) THE LEDGER-TEXT ROUND TRIP, which the write-path ENSURES does NOT cover: that promise re-scores an
#      in-memory AckRecord and never touches renderAckRecords/readAckRecords, so a serialisation or parsing
#      bug is invisible to it — and prov=, the tri-state and the omitted-when-Measured rule are all exactly
#      that class. A hand-written fixture ledger carries the shapes the binary never emits (permuted token
#      order, an unknown prov= value, a half pair, a ':' inside p=), the shipping binary reads and rewrites
#      it, and the result is checked from the bytes — including that no row ever carries both a measurement
#      and a reconstruction, which the fold ordering is supposed to make unreachable;
#   e) a reconstruction whose group is NO LONGER FOUND is left intact and reported unverified, never deleted.
#      prov=recon is a cache — re-derived on every ack that can check it — but "not found" is a floor, not a
#      verdict: a scoped scan, a capped file, or a ledger read beside a different tree all produce it, and
#      arm 7's transplant probe is one of them. Deleting derived data on a floor is irreversible.
#
# `strip_prov` is a FUNCTION, not three copies of the same regex: the two fixtures below strip the same way,
# and a lookahead (never consuming the separating space) is what makes back-to-back `now=N was=N` tokens both
# match — a naive ' now=\d+ ' eats the space its neighbour needs and silently leaves half a triple behind.
