# rootrelemitcheck.sh — the ROOT-RELATIVE EMISSION contract: no emitted document may carry the corpus
# checkout's absolute path anywhere except the ONE envelope attribute that declares the root.
#
#   test/rootrelemitcheck.sh
#   RIPWIRE_BIN=asan/ripwire test/rootrelemitcheck.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. ing.files[] holds each path exactly as derived from the run's OWN root argument, so an
# absolute root ("ripwire /abs/repo") makes every emitted p=/id= carry the checkout prefix verbatim. That is
# a per-ROW cost against a per-DOCUMENT fact: a peer session measured ~4.8 B of bundle per character of
# checkout depth (26 absolute-path occurrences in one --partition core bundle — 21 path-qualified id= keys
# plus 5 root echoes), which is how two byte-ceiling gates came to depend on where the repo happened to be
# checked out (PLAN_HARVEST_REPORTS_2026-08-20/latent-gates-lane.md pinned both, deliberately, as the
# interim). This gate pins the product cure instead: the root is stated ONCE, every other path is relative
# to it, and the document a consumer receives is therefore INDEPENDENT of checkout depth.
#
# The multi-root run already behaves exactly this way -- <root label="…" p="…"/> declares each root once and
# every <f p="label/…"> is relative to it -- so this gate holds the SINGLE-root run to the standard its own
# multi-root sibling already meets, using the same rootRelativeUri()/pathRel() relativizer (sarif.h).
#
# What it proves, per verb, across all three dialects (XML / JSON / MCP):
#   ARM 1  DEPTH-INDEPENDENCE — the same corpus at two very different absolute depths emits BYTE-IDENTICAL
#          documents once the root spelling itself is masked. This is the cure proof: nothing but the
#          envelope anchor may vary with checkout depth.
#   ARM 2  NO ABSOLUTE PATHS — every occurrence of the absolute root in a document sits inside a disclosed
#          envelope anchor (root="…" / "root":"…" / <root label= p=…/>). Anything else is a leak.
#   ARM 3  SPELLING EQUIVALENCE — `ripwire /abs/corpus` and (cd /abs/corpus && `ripwire .`) emit the same
#          document once the anchor is masked. An absolute root is now just a spelling, not a content change.
#   ARM 4  THE ANCHOR SURVIVES — relativizing must not delete the root: each document that names any path
#          still declares its root exactly once, so a consumer can still resolve what it was given.
#
# The two depths differ by 96 characters, so a single un-relativized row is a multi-byte difference ARM 1
# cannot miss. A pre-cure binary fails ARM 1 and ARM 2 by construction.
#
# Exit 0 = ALL PASS, non-zero = SOME FAILED.

# ── ARM 9 — THE COMMAND ECHOES: one absolute root per document, even when a runner IS derivable ─────────
# A3 (PLAN_OUTPUT_ROUTING_LOOP §1.5): the arms above sweep a fixture with NO runner script, so every test row
# reads run_unknown="1" and the one emitter that pastes a PATH INSIDE A COMMAND — testmap.h's spell() — was
# never exercised by them. It spelled diskPath(), i.e. the whole checkout prefix, so `--test-gate` on an
# absolute root printed the root three times (the anchor, next=, and every <t> row's run=) and `--situ`
# printed it once per runnable test line. That is a per-ROW cost against a per-DOCUMENT fact, exactly what
# ARM 1/2/5 exist to forbid; it simply had no fixture that could see it.
#
# So this arm builds one: the fixture plus a real runner script whose text names the changed harness (the
# MENTION evidence kind), which makes run= and next= materialize on every verb that echoes a command. It then
# asserts the same three properties the matrix above asserts — one anchor, no other absolute path, depth
# independence — AND the property that makes relativizing safe: the echoed command still RUNS from the root.
