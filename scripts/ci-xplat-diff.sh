# ci-xplat-diff.sh — Windows vs Linux: the same verbs on the same fixture must print the same bytes.
#
# Reads two directories written by scripts/ci-xplat-outputs.sh (Linux: the ubuntu-24.04 Release clang leg; Windows:
# the packaged, UNZIPPED windows-x64 release binary) and applies exactly these rules — nothing is normalised away:
#   R1 identity   every output the Linux side wrote (*.xml, *.rc, *.json, *.txt; *.err is platform notes and is
#                 skipped) exists on the Windows side and is byte-identical. No path-separator, line-ending or
#                 case folding is applied: '/' is the only separator either platform may print, and "\n" the only
#                 line ending (stdout is binary on Windows, os::init_process).
#   R2 separator  the Windows-only bslash-map.xml (root typed as test\fixture) is byte-identical to Linux's
#                 repo-map.xml: a root typed with '\' enters the program as '/' (os::normalize_path_arg), and root=
#                 and every p= print it that way.
#   R3 CRLF       on EACH side, crlf-{map,for,callers,impact} equal tree-{map,for,callers,impact}: CRLF line endings
#                 change no symbol, rank, edge, line number or count. crlf-expand is narrowed, not exempt: on EACH
#                 side, crlf-expand must equal tree-expand once CR bytes and the reason=/est_tokens= attributes are
#                 dropped — so a CRLF-only line-number (l=) or symbol-list bug in --expand is still caught even when
#                 the two platforms happen to agree. It is also still under R1, so both platforms must print the
#                 SAME CRLF bytes.
#   R0 rc floor   every Linux-side *.rc must be 0. A verb that fails the same way on both platforms (rc != 0 on
#                 both, same error bytes) would otherwise pass R1 vacuously.
